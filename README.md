Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
Welcome to my machine learning mini-project! 
In this project, I built a Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on:

Years of experience

Test scores

Interview scores

The goal was to understand the basics of regression and how real-world features can help predict outcomes like salaries.

What I Did
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, and mapped text numbers (like "five", "six") to integers.

Model Training:
Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

Prediction:
Made salary predictions for new candidate profiles.

Evaluation:
Plotted True Values vs. Predicted Values to visualize model performance and calculated the RÂ² Score.

 Project Structure
hiring.csv âž” Raw dataset containing experience, test scores, interview scores, and salaries.

hiringUpdated.csv âž” Cleaned dataset (after handling missing values and converting text numbers to integers).

hiring.ipynb âž” Jupyter Notebook with full code for preprocessing, training, prediction, and evaluation.

housePrice.ipynb âž” Additional practice notebook for house price prediction (bonus learning!).

Results
Achieved an RÂ² Score of ~40% (still room for improvement! ).

Good first hands-on project to understand feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

Thanks for checking out my project! ðŸ™Œ
